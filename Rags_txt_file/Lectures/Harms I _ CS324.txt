Lectures /Harms I
In this lecture, we will begin our exploration of the harms of large language models. In this
course, we will cover several of these harms, largely following the foundation models report .
performance disparties (this lecture)
social biases and stereotypes (this lecture)
toxicity (next lecture)
misinformation (next lecture)
security and privacy risks (lecture six)
copyright and legal protections (lecture seven)
environmental impact (lecture fourteen)
centralization of power (lecture fifteen)
Harms in Emer ging T echnologies.  In general, we want to keep in mind the close relationship
between the capabilities and harms of these models. The potential presented by their capabilities
is what will lead to these models being adopted, and causing their harms. So, in general,
improvements in capabilities generally lead to greater adoption/use, which then lead to greater
harm in aggregate.
Harms, Safety , and Ethics in other fields.  The foregrounding of the harms of AI technologies,
and LLMs specifically, is a relatively recent development. Let’s first consider some of the high-
level ideas and approaches used in disciplines with established traditions around harm and
safety.•

Belmont R epor t and IRB.
The Belmont R eport was written in 1979 as a report that outlines three principles ( respect
for per sons , beneficence , and justice ).
The report is the basis for the Institutional R eview Board (IRB).
IRBs are committees that review and approve research involving human subjects, as a
proactiv e mechanism for ensuring safety.1

Bioethics and CRISPR.
When gene-editing technologies list CRISPR CAS were created, the biomedicine
community set community standar ds prohibitting the use of these technologies for
many forms of human gene-editing.2
•In this lecture, we will focus on fairly concrete and lower-level concerns regarding the harms of
LLMs. However.
there are broader societal policies that can be powerful tools for increasing safety, and
the absence of strong theory makes it hard to provide guarantees for the safety/harms of
LLMs.
Harms related to Performance Disp arities.  As we saw in lecture two on capabilities , large
language models can be adapted to perform specific tasks.
For specific tasks (e.g. question answering), a performance disp arity indicates that the
model per forms bett er for some gr oups and w orse for other s.
For example, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems work worse for Black speakers than
White speakers ( Koenecke et al., 2020 ).
Feedb ack loops  can implify disparities over time: if systems don’t work for some users, they
won’t use these systems and less data is generated, leading future systems to demonstrate
greater disparities.
Harms related to Social Biases and S tereotypes.
Social biases  are systematic associations of some concept (e.g. science) with some groups
(e.g. men) over others (e.g. women).
Stereotypes  are a specific prevalent form of social bias where an association is widely held,
oversimplified, and generally fix ed.
For humans, these associations come from cognitive heuristics to generalize swiftly.
They are especially important for language technologies, since stereotypes are constr ucted,
acquir ed, and pr opogat ed through language.
Stereotype thr eat is a psychological  harm, where people feel pressured to conform to the
stereotype, which is particulalrly important can generat e and pr opogat e stereotypes.
Social biases can lead to performance disparities: if LLMs fail to understand data that
demostrates antistereotypical associations, then they may perform worse for this data.When a member of the community was found to violate these standards, they were
expelled from the community, which reflects the strong enfor cement o f community
norms.•
FDA and Food Safety .
The Food and Drug Administration (FD A) is a regulat ory body tasked with the safety
standards.
The FD A tests food and drugs, often with multiple stages, to verify their safety.
The FD A uses established theor y from scientific disciplines to determine what to test for.3

•Social Gr oups in Language.  For text, we can identify social groups based on the:
Producer (i.e. author/speaker; e.g. African American English in Blodgett et al. (2016) ),
Audience (i.e. reader/listener; e.g. police language directed at Blacks in Voigt et al. (2017) ),
Content (i.e. people mentioned in the text; e.g. female, male, non-binary in Dinan et al.
(2020) ).
Identif ying Social Gr oups.
Often, we do not know who produced or who is addressed by particular text.
While we can detect which groups are mentioned in text, this is not generally annotated.
In the social sciences, self-identified  group information is often seen as ideal (e.g. Saperstein
(2006) ).
Most words use the presence of certain words (e.g. explicitly gendered words like “her” as well
as statistically predictive strings like first and last names) to identify content-based groups
and language/dialect identifiers to identify speaker-based groups.
What Social Gr oups ar e of interest?
Protected attr ibutes are demographic features that may not be used as the basis for
decisions in the US (e.g. race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, nationality, disability
status, physical appearance, socioeconomic status)
Many of these attributes are significantly cont ested (e.g. race, gender), they are human-
constr ucted categories as opposed to “natural” divisions, and existing work in AI often fails to
reflect their contemporary treatment in the social sciences (e.g. binary gender vs. more fluid
notions of gender; see Cao and Daumé III (2020) , Dev et al. (2021) ).
Protected groups are not the only important groups, though they are a good starting point:
the relevant groups are culturally and contextually specific (Sambasivan et al., 2021) .
Historically Mar ginalization.
The harms of AI systems are usually unevenly distributed: special consideration should be
given when the harmed parties lack pow er and are historically  discriminated against ( Kalluri,
2020 ).
Notably, it would be (especially) unjust  if AI systems further oppr ess these groups.
Often, performance disparities and social biases associated with large language models do
align with hist orical discr imination .
Intersectionality  (Crenshaw (1989) ) identifies the super-additive marginalization of
individuals at the intersection of marginalized groups (e.g. Black women).Social Gr oups

Motivation: T est how models understand and behave for text involve people’s names
Original T ask: SQuAD - S tanford Question Answering Datasets  (Rajpurkar et al. (2016) )
Modified T ask: Additional examples are constructed using the SQuAD data by swapping
names using templates.
Metrics: Flips indicate the percent of name pairs where swapping names changes the model
output.

Answer: Hilar y
Results:
Models generally predict names associated with famous people that correspond to what they
are known for.
The effects quickly decade for less famous people.
Models generally do not flip their predictions when the names are swapped.

Results.
GPT-3 demonstrates very strong associations of Muslims with violence (more than 60% of
completions were violent).
This bias is very persistent and can be elicited in several ways.
StereoSet ( Nadeem et al., 2021 ).
Motivation: evaluate a model’s behavior on text involving stereotypes
Task: compare the model probabilities for sentences with stereotypical and anti-stereotypical
associations.
Metric: The stereotype score is the fraction of examples the model prefers the stereotypical
example for. The authors indicate a score of 0.5 is ideal.

•metrics cannot be simultaneously minimized ( Kleinberg et al., 2016 ) and fail to capture what
stakeholders want from algorithms ( Saha et al., 2020 ).
Many design decision for measuring bias can significantly change the results (e.g. word lists,
decoding parameters; [Antoniak and Mimno (2021)] (https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-
long.148.pdf)).
Existing benchmarks for LLMs have been the subject of significant critiques ( Blodgett et al.,
2021 ).
Many of the upstream measurements of bias do not reliably predict downstream performance
disparities and material harms ( Goldfarb-T arrant et al., 2021 ).
LLMs have the potential to cause harm in a variety of ways, including through performance
disparities and social biases.
Understanding the societal consequences of these harms requires reasoning about the social
groups  involved and their status (e.g. historical mar ginalization , lack o f pow er).
Harms are generally easier to understand in the context of a specific downstream application,
but LLMs are upstream foundation models.
Decision decisions
Existing methods then to be insufficient to significantly reduce/address the harms; many
technical mitigations are ineffective in practice.
Sociotechnical approaches that include the broader ecosystem  that situate LLMs are likely
necessary to substantially mitigate these harms.
